## Firmware Files

The FW files are hosted on the Infineon GitHub, except for the 2AE-USB and 2BC-USB FW files.
These are hosted by Murata in the Murata GitHub, because the USB FW contain Murata specific
NVRAM files integrated.

Place the downloaded production FW file in "/lib/firmware/cypress" folder before loading
the driver. Refer to the table below for the firmware files.

###  Note:
1. For 2AE-SDIO, rename the "cyfmac4373-sdio.industrial.bin" FW file to "cyfmac4373-sdio.bin" before using.
2. For 2AE-USB, rename the "cyfmac4373-usb.2AE.bin" FW file to "cyfmac4373.bin" before using.
3. For 2BC-USB, rename the "cyfmac4373-usb.2BC.bin" FW file to "cyfmac4373.bin" before using.
4. Same firmware file (cyfmac54591-sdio.bin) is used for 2BZ and 1XA. 2BZ is based out of IFX chipset 54590.
